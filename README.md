# ðŸš§ Portfolio Under Construction ðŸš§

Welcome to my portfolio repository! I'm just getting started on the homepage, with a design inspired by Frontend Mentor's minimalist portfolio template. The project is in its early stages, so thereâ€™s still a lot to be done.

### Technologies I'm Using:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and React-based frontend.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved code quality.
- **Zod**: For schema validation.
- **Zustand**: For state management.

### What to Expect:
- [ ] Homepage layout and design
- [ ] Integration of personal projects and case studies
- [ ] Responsive and accessible design enhancements
- [ ] More content and features in the near future

Feel free to explore what's here so far, and check back for updates as I build out the rest of the site!
