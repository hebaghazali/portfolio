# ðŸš§ Portfolio Under Construction ðŸš§

This is the repository for my personal portfolio, which is very much a work in progress. I'm just getting started on the homepage, using a minimalist design that I created based on a Figma design from Frontend Mentor.

### Tech Stack:
- **Next.js**: For building the frontend with server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: To keep the codebase clean and type-safe.
- **Zod**: For seamless schema validation.
- **Zustand**: To manage state effectively.

### What's Next:
- [ ] Completing the homepage layout and design
- [ ] Developing a portfolio section to showcase my projects in detail.
- [ ] Creating a blog to share insights and experiences.
- [ ] Adding a contact page for easy communication.
- [ ] Ensuring the site is fully responsive
- [ ] Continuous improvements and refinements
